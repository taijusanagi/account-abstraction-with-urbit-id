This concept is inspired by the above Encode club \* Urbit workshop

## How it works

### Account Abstraction

![account-abstraction](./docs/account-abstraction.png)

This is the meta-transaction process with the ERC4337 account abstraction standard.

1. Connect dApp with Wallet Connect
2. The request is sent to the app
3. Tx is sent from the backend

### Interact with Urbit

![interact-with-urbit](./docs/interact-with-urbit.png)

In the above process, the request is signed by Metamask, but we are going to sign the transaction with Urbit as a non-custodial agent.

## Technical Detail
